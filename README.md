# b8ball
Welcome to the 8 Ball App Flutter project! This project is designed to help you create a mobile app that provides randomized answers to user questions using the Flutter framework.

## Getting Started

In this project, you will be asked to create a mobile app that emulates the popular "Magic 8 Ball" toy. The app will allow the user to ask a question and receive a randomized answer. The app will also have a button to shake the 8 ball to generate a new answer.
